            Founded in 2026, Nextech began as a small startup in a
            garage in Silicon Valley. Our founders, a group of
            passionate tech enthusiasts, had a vision
            of harnessing the power of emerging technologies to
            create a better future. They believed in the potential
            of AI, robotics, and quantum computing to revolutionize
            the way we live and work.
          </p>
          <div class="history-circle2 history-circle desktop"></div>
          <p>
            In our early years, we focused on research and development, pushing the
            boundaries of what was possible with technology. We quickly gained a
            reputation for innovation and creativity, and our team grew rapidly. By
            2028, we had moved into a state-of-the-art headquarters and had teams
            working on a range of exciting projects.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          <div class="history-circle3 history-circle desktop"></div>
          <p>
            In 2030, we launched our first product, an AI-powered personal ass
            that was years ahead of its competition. This marked
            a turning point for Nextech, and we became recognized
            as a global leader in AI technology. Over the next few
            years, we expanded our product range
            to include advanced robotics and quantum computing
            systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, just a decade after our founding, Nextech is a global
            technology powerhouse. We have offices in cities around the world,
            and our products are used by millions of people every day. Despite
            our growth, we remain true to our original vision. We're still a
            team of passionate tech enthusiasts, and we're still committed to
            using technology to create a better future.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we look to the future, we're excited about the possibilities.
            We're working on some of our most ambitious projects yet, and we
            can't wait to share them with the world. Here's to the next decade
            of innovation at Nextech!
