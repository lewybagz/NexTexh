# Nextech
Nextexh is a (fictional) cutting-edge technology company offering a range of products including AI Personal Assistants, VR Gaming Systems, and more. This repository contains the code for the official Nextexh website.

## Creative Process
The entire creative process for the Nextexh website was meticulously crafted by me. From the initial concept and design to the development and implementation of various features, every aspect of the site reflects my vision and dedication. The project showcases my skills in front-end development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and demonstrates my ability to create an engaging and user-friendly interface.

I took great care in ensuring that the site's aesthetics align with the innovative spirit of Nextexh, using modern design principles and animations to create a visually appealing experience. The site also includes a fully functional shopping cart feature, complete with animations and interactive elements, all of which were custom-built by me.

This project serves as an early testament to my passion for web development and my commitment to delivering high-quality work. Whether you're interested in the code, the design, or the overall creative process, I invite you to explore the repository and see what Nextexh has to offer.
